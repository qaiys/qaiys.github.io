      <h2>The Role of Agriculture in China's Economy</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture has been the backbone of China's economy for thousands of years. Today, it remains a critical sector, employing over 300 million people and contributing significantly to the country's GDP. From the rice paddies of the south to the wheat fields of the north, Chinese agriculture is as diverse as its geography.

      <p>
        One notable example is the use of vertical farming in urban areas. With limited arable land and a growing population, vertical farms allow for efficient use of space and resources, producing fresh vegetables and herbs year-round.

        Farmers are also adopting traditional practices, such as crop rotation and intercropping, to maintain soil health and biodiversity. These methods, combined with modern technology, are helping to create a more sustainable future for Chinese agriculture.
